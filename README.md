We are The Trifocals of JCM Early College.

It has been an adventure creating our first website! Our first client quit corresponding with us, so we had to find a new client and start over. This client is a trucking company. Unfortunately, the enthusiasm of our new client quickly diminished, and we were back to no communication. Long story short, we ended up having to use stock photos for the images we used so that we could enhance the website.

Our website is not content-heavy as our client's wish was for a simple, clean website. We included the basic information he sent us on the Home Page, About Page, and Contact Page. He told us to be creative with our design. For example, he did not like the colors on his business card. This led our team to choose a blue hue for part of our design. We compromised on a shade of blue to for our theme. We each worked on one page and at the end put them all together.

We chose a font that we thought looked most pleasing. We kept the background white and simple because of our client's wishes. We used Bootstrap for our Nav Bar and are pleased with how it turned out. A form was used on the Contact page to show the business hours. Getting our page to be responsive took us a while. We think we finally have media queries figured out.

Our team has had different perspectives on a lot of things, but in the end, we always came up with a solution. At first we didn't know each other. Now we have become close through teamwork and are good friends.  We hope you enjoy viewing our website.
