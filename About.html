            <img class="img_j" src="img/mr-williamson.jpg" alt="Photo of Jerald Williamson" style="float:left;">
       
     <p>Jerald Williamson was born on December 24, 1984. He grew up in a small house with his mother, father, and older brother. As a child he was always fascinated with cars and driving.</p>
       
<p>At age 16, when Jerald acquired his license, he realized driving was what he wanted to do with his life. Years later he amassed jobs for companies like Coca-Cola, Best Buy, and Kroger. At all of these jobs he wanted to do the same thing- drive. The thrill and devotion he had to the activity was unmatched. Everyone knew it was his passion and what he wanted to do in life, but all he really wanted to do was make himself proud and determine his own definition of success.</p>

    <p>Finally, in 2019 he built up the courage and resources to pursue his dream. Buying a truck and getting his name out there were his first steps. At first business was slow. Now business couldn't be better and he's found his definition of success.</p>
